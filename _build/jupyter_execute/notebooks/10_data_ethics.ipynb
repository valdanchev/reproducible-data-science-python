    "# Data Ethics, Bias, and Fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics of data ethics, privacy, and fairness should be at the beginning of a data science textbook, not at the end. Indeed, next drafts should integrate ethical challenges earlier in the textbook. Data ethics is the last topic in this version for two reasons. First, an informed discussion of data ethics issues requires to first build some intuitions about the data science lifecycle and what can go wrong in that lifecycle, including different sources of bias. Learning how to evaluate models in general is a precondition for evaluating models for bias and fairness. Second, moving beyond the issues of data ethics to possible mitigation strategies also requires some exposure to approaches we covered earlier in the course, for example causal inference. Finally, although our focused discussion on data ethics comes last, we discuss issues of data design and biases (e.g., algorithmic confounding), transparency and reproducibility, and other topics of ethical data science throughout the textbook.\n",
