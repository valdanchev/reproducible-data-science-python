    "Textbook outline\n",
    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "The textbook provides an accessible hands-on introduction to data science techniques, skills, and workflows necessary to perform open, reproducible, and ethical data analysis. In the textbook, you will study research problems of real-world relevance, such as vaccine hesitancy and the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on human mobility. You will use real-world social data, including large-scale anonymised mobility data from digital sources and recent COVID-19 survey data. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will engage with open reproducible data science workflows using open-source and free computational tools, including the Python programming language, Jupyter notebook in the Cloud, Markdown, version control, and the Open Science Framework. No software installation or setup is required as you will use cloud computing. Specifically, you will use Jupyter notebooks on your laptop or tablet (or even smartphone) via free cloud environments such as the Colaboratory (Colab for short) or MyBinder. Fortunately, the Python data science community have developed an open source ecosystem of libraries for data analysis, statistical modelling, machine learning, and network analysis, including the libraries `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, and `networkX`. This suite of libraries will allow us to analyse, visualise, and model data at easy, with minimal programming requirements, while focusing on reproducible analysis of social data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of all, this textbook aims to contribute to inclusive, diverse, and supportive learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key themes\n",
    "Throughout the textbook, you will learn, in an accessible way, practical data science skills, including data wrangling, clustering, resampling, and visualisation of various data sources as well as applications of techniques from machine learning (e.g., cross-validation to mitigate the risk of overfitting), causal inference (e.g., causal graphs to detect confounding), and network analysis (e.g., community detection to discover tightly knit communities). The content is organised around four foundational data science tasks — (i) data preprocessing, (ii) description (and exploratory data analysis and visualisation), (iii) prediction, and (iv) causal inference (which includes counterfactuals). Attention is given to model evaluation and problems of overfitting, selection bias, confounding, and computational reproducibility. Throughout the textbook are discussed issues of data ethics, privacy, and fairness of data science models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The textbook teaches you how to critically evaluate data and biases intrinsic to real-world data and real-time data (many of the COVID-19 data set we use are updated daily). Instead of looking for 'positive' results and 'statistically significant' relationships as a way of finding order in often disorderly data, you will learn open and reproducible workflow. In this workflow, you will describe your steps throughout the research process (not just your final results), make transparent choices of parameter selection, and document in your notebooks the results you have obtained, however 'useful' or '(un)expected' they may seem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Prior knowledge of programming is not required as coding for data analysis will be taught from first principles. Background in mathematics or statistics are not required beyond basic algebra and descriptive statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Who this textbook is for\n",
    "The textbook would be ideal for students in the social sciences, public health, and related fields who want to study real-world problems using diverse data sets but lack data science knowledge and coding skill.\n",

    "# What is Reproducible Data Science? \n",
    "\n",
    "The textbook is designed around an understanding of data science as the use of coding to draw conclusions from diverse data sets by solving five classes of tasks (see [Ani Adhikari and John DeNero, 2020](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/01/what-is-data-science.html); [Hernán et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1080/09332480.2019.1579578)): \n",
    "1. _Data preprocessing_ — preparing data for analysis using techniques for data cleaning, data wrangling, and data transformation.\n",
    "2. _Description_ — discovering patterns in data using exploratory data analysis, visualisation, and automated discovery techniques.\n",
    "3. _Prediction_ — using information about outcomes we know to make informed guesses about unknown outcomes by applying techniques from simple regression to (supervised) machine learning.\n",
    "4. _Causal data analysis_ — studying cause-and-effect questions via the application of causal graphs, counterfactuals, and causal inference techniques.\n",
    "5. _Inference_ — quantifying our degree of certainty to determine whether what we find in our data will hold among different scenarios using resampling methods and related techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This textbook does not cover a single data science task in detail but introduces you to these tasks with a focus on real-world data and applications, hands-on computation, and reproducible data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical [Data Science Lifecycle](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/01/lifecycle_intro.html), we will begin with a research question, and then select our data set(s), preprocess the data, perform descriptive analysis to explore basic features of our data, and then model our data to predict an outcome or establish causal effect. Throughout the data science lifecycle, transparency of research process and computational reproducibility are essential. \n",
    "\n",
    "This understanding of data science is inspired by many, including the UC Berkeley's data science program, particularly the courses [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](http://data8.org/sp21) and [Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science](https://ds100.org), and the associated textbooks, open educational resources, and communities; Matthew Salganik's book [Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/); The Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science by Chris Bail and Matt Salganik and associated [learning resources](https://sicss.io/overview); Ramesh Johari's course at Stanford University [Fundamentals of Data Science](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande226/); The Turing Way Community and their [Turing Way: A Handbook for Reproducible Data Science](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome). Finally, the UC Berkeley's 2020 [Workshop on Data Science Education](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/data-science-education-resources/2020-national-workshop-data-science-education) was instrumental in building both my vision and toolkit for democratising data science.\n",

This feedback from a student captures it well: \"i was genuinely terrified when the term started and i saw coding and python but this has been great thank you!\". I also thank Kirils Makarovs and Hamid Nejadghorban for assistance with teaching earlier iterations of the learning resource.\n",
