    "The terms of reproducibility (and computational reproducibility) and replicability are sometimes used interchangeably but they differ. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Reproducibility** means \"obtaining consistent results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, and conditions of analysis\"; it is synonymous with computational reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Replicability** \"means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why does reproducibility and replicability matter?** \"Reproducibility and replicability are often cited as hallmarks of good science. Being able to reproduce the computational results of another researcher starting with the same data and replicating a previous study to test its results facilitate the self-correcting nature of science.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why do we study computational reproducibility right now?** \"Computational reproducibility is more prominent now than ever because of the growth in reliance on computing across all of science. When a researcher reports a study and makes the underlying data and code available, those results should be computationally reproducible by another researcher.\"\n",

    "# Open Reproducible Workflow in Jupyter/Colab Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of reproducible research is the integration of various components, including data gathering, data manipulation, data analysis and outputs in an open research workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) and [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index#) notebooks are an open-source web applications that allow you to create and share documents that contain code, equations, visualisations and narrative text. While a popular tool for [data exploration](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1), the notebook can also support your reproducible research workflow by integrating **executable code**, **data inputs**, **results**, and **documentation** within a single notebook, along with **images**, **HTML**, **LaTeX**, **videos** and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous session, you have learned how to use the Jupyter / Colab notebook to:\n",
    "* run code interactively using the [`Python`](https://www.python.org) programming language and\n",
    "* document your code and outputs using [`Markdown`](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), an open and easy-to-use markup language for creating formatted text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing your `Python` code and `Markdown` documentation within Jupyter/Colab notebooks facilitates open and reproducible science workflow through integration of various components — data inputs, code for data manipulation, analysis, visualisation, and results — within a single file that can be openly shared and communicated with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter/Colab notebooks support reproducibility but do not guarantee it. In fact, a recent [study](https://blog.jetbrains.com/datalore/2020/12/17/we-downloaded-10-000-000-jupyter-notebooks-from-github-this-is-what-we-learned/) of 10 million Jupyter notebooks hosted on GitHub have found that 36 per cent of the notebooks could not be reproduced because the code cells were not originally executed in a linear order. The tool is not sufficient for reproducible data analysis. We also need a reproducible research workflow that helps us transition from [\"nonlinear, interactive, trial-and-error style of exploration to a more linear and reproducible analysis based on organized, packaged, and tested code\" (Jake VanderPlas, 2017)](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/03/03/reproducible-data-analysis-in-jupyter/).  \n"

    "\n",
    "> ***Document the process, not just the results*** — \"... make sure to document all your explorations, even (or perhaps especially) those that led to dead ends. These comments will help you remember what you did and ... why you chose a particular parameter value, where you copied a block of code from, or what you found interesting about an intermediate result.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Use cell divisions to make steps clear*** — \"... try to make each cell in your notebook perform one meaningful step of the analysis that is easy to understand from the code in the cell or the surrounding markdown description. Modularize your code by cells and label the cells with markdown above the cell. Think of each cell as being one paragraph, having one function, or accomplishing one task (for example, create a plot).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Modularize code*** — \"It is always good practice to avoid duplicate code, but in notebooks, it is especially easy to copy a cell, tweak a few lines, paste the resulting code into a new cell or another notebook, and run it again. This form of experimentation is expedient but makes notebooks difficult to read and nearly impossible to maintain if you want to change the functionality of or fix a bug in the copied code. Instead, wrap code you are about to copy and reuse in a function, which you can then call from as many cells as desired.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Record dependencies*** — \"Rerunning your analysis in the future will require accessing not only your code but also any module or library that your code relied on.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Use version control*** — \"Version control is a critical adjunct to notebook use because the interactive nature of notebooks makes it easy to accidentally change or delete important content. Furthermore, since notebooks contain code and code inevitably contains bugs, being able to determine the history of when a given bug you have discovered was introduced to the code versus when it was fixed—and thus what analyses it may have affected—is a key capability in scientific computation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Git and GitHub are widely used tools for version control [[see Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub (Perez-Riverol et al, 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947) but are known to have a steep learning curve. For version control, we will use the built-in Colab functionality Revision history, which can be accessed from `File` —> `Revision history`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Design your notebooks to be read, run, and reused*** — \"... store your notebooks in a public code repository with a clear README file and a liberal open source license granting permission to reuse your code.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Public code repositories that enable code sharing, team collaboration, and open source licensing include [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com), [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Share and explain your data*** — \"Having access to a clearly annotated notebook is of little use to those wanting to reproduce or extend your results if the underlying data are locked away. Strive to make your data or a sample of your data publicly available along with the notebook.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Data repositories for medium to large sized anonymized data include [figshare](https://figshare.com/), [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), and [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/our_mission)."
