    "\n",
    "To write readable, consistent, and clean code, it is important to consider the [PEP 8 (or Python Enhancement Proposal) style guide for Python code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). The guide describes the rules for writing a readable Python code. Below are outlined key rules to keep in mind when you write your Python code (for details and examples, check out the [PEP 8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Naming conventions**\n",
    "    * Variable names (e.g., `even_numbers`) should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.\n",
    "    * Names to avoid (as, in some fonts, they are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero): the characters ‘l’ (lowercase letter el), ‘O’ (uppercase letter oh), or ‘I’ (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Comments**\n",
    "    * PEP 8 distinguishes block comments, inline comments, and documentation strings (or docstrings for short):\n",
    "        * Block comments in Python's code cells apply to the lines of code that follows them, and follow the same indentation as the code. Block comments are typically formed of complete sentences, each sentence starting with a capitalized word and ending in a period. Each line of a block comment starts with a hashtag symbol `#` followed by a single space and some text.\n",
    "        * Line comments appears on the same line as a statement and is separated by at least two spaces from the statement. Each line comment starts with a hashtag symbol `#` followed by a single space and some text.\n",
    "        * Dockstrings are used to document Python modules, functions, classes, or methods. Docstrings are surrounded by `\"\"\"triple double quotes\"\"\"`. You likely read docstrings more often (for example, when accessing help information about a function) than write them. See [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#documentation-strings) for details on docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Maximum line length**\n",
    "    * Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. To split a long command over multiple lines, one can break down code into readable statements using parenthesis. Another approach is to use the backslash symbol `\\`. \n",
    "    * Long blocks of text (comments) should be limited to 72 characters. \n",
    "    * When applicable and agreed upon, it would be okay to increase the line length limit up to 99 characters, provided that comments are still limited to 72 characters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Indentation**\n",
    "    * Indentation in Python is the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Indentation is important not only because of code readability but particularly because in Python statements arranged at the same indentation level are considered to form part of a single code block. So, incorrect indentation in Python would likely produce an IndentationError or an errorless output.\n",
    "    * Use 4 spaces per indentation level.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tabs or Spaces?**\n",
    "    * Spaces are the preferred indentation method.\n",
    "    * Python disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Whitespace in Expressions and Statements**\n",
    "    * Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc.), comparisons (==, <, >, !=, <>, <=, >=, in, not in, is, is not), Booleans (and, or, not). (e.g., `sorted_even_numbers = sorted(even_numbers)`)\n",
    "    * Don’t use spaces around the `=` sign when used to indicate a keyword argument (e.g., `reverse=True`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in PEP 8, section *A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds*, style guide recommendations may not be applicable in some circumstances. In such circumstances, you could look for examples from the Python community and use your best judgment.  "

    "# Running Terminal commands in Jupyter/Colab notebook\n",

Terminal commands are very useful for obtaining information (for example, you can check the version of your Jupyter notebook, Python, or packages), managing computer files, and installing Python packages. \n",

Any command appearing after the mark in the line will not be executed from the Python environment but from your operating system's command-line interface (CLI). You can think of the exclamation mark (`!`) as introducing command-line interface (You can learn more about the command-line interfaces from [this tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) by The Carpentries). \n",
    "\n",
