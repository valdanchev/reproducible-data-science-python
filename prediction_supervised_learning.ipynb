    "\n",
    "[Prediction](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09332480.2019.1579578) is a data science task among other data science tasks, including description and causal inference. [Prediction](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a6r9g/) is the use of data to map some input _(X)_ to  an  output  _(Y)_. The prediction task is called _classification_ when the output variable is categorical (or discrete), and _regression_ when it is continuous. Our focus in this session will be on classification."

As a result of overfitting, the model produces accurate predictions for examples from the sample at hand but will predict poorly new examples the model has never seen.\n",

    "To avoid overfitting, data is typically split into three groups: \n",
    "* Training set — used to train models \n",
    "* Validation set — used to tune the model and estimate  model performance/accuracy for best model selection\n",
    "* Test set - used to evaluate the generalisability of the model to new observations the model has never seen\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data set is not large enough, a possible strategy, which we will use here, is to split the data into training set and test set, and use cross-validation on the training set to evaluate our models' performance/accuracy. We will use 2/3 of the data to train the predictive model and the remaining 1/3 to create the test set.   "

    "# Model evaluation using Cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your two models are fitted, you can evaluate the accuracy of their prediction. In older approaches, the prediction accuracy is often calculated on the same set of training data used to fit the model. The problem of such an approach is that the model can 'memorise' the training data and show high prediction accuracy on that data set while failing to perform well on new data. For this reason, approaches in data science, and machine learning in particular, prefer to evaluate the prediction accuracy of a model on new data that has not been used in training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The cross-validation technique\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation is a methodology to assess accuracy of model prediction without relying on in-sample prediction. We will split our training set into _k_ equal folds or parts. The number of folds can differ but for simplicity we will consider 5-fold cross-validation. How does 5-fold cross-validation work? While keeping aside one fold (or part), we fit the model with the remaining four folds and use the fitted model to predict outcomes of observations in fold one and on this basis compute model prediction accuracy. We repeat the procedure for all 5 folds or parts of the data and compute the average prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics to evaluate model performance\n",
    "Many [metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#scoring-parameter) to evaluate model performance exist. We evaluate model performance using the accuracy score. The accuracy score is the simplest metric for evaluating classification models. Simply put, accuracy is the proportion of predictions our model got right. Keep in mind, however, that because of the unbalanced class problem, accuracy may not be the best metric in our case. Because one of our classes accounts for 84.6% of the cases, even a model that uniformly predicts that all respondents are likely to take up the vaccine will obtain very high accuracy of 0.846 while being useless for identifying respondents who are unlikely to take up the vaccine. We will return to this problem shortly."
